   - **Customer List Screen**: Display the list of customers.
   - **Add New Customer Screen**: Enable the creation of new customers, deletion, and updating of existing ones.

## Testing with cURL

You can use cURL commands to test the API endpoints:

```bash
# Authenticate and get Bearer token
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"login_id": "test@sunbasedata.com", "password": "Test@123"}' https://qa2.sunbasedata.com/sunbase/portal/api/assignment_auth.jsp

# Create a new customer
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer token_recieved_in_authentication_API_call" -d '{"first_name": "Jane", "last_name": "Doe", "street": "Elvnu Street", "address": "H no 2", "city": "Delhi", "state": "Delhi", "email": "sam@gmail.com", "phone": "12345678"}' https://qa2.sunbasedata.com/sunbase/portal/api/assignment.jsp?cmd=create

# Get customer list
curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer token_recieved_in_authentication_API_call" https://qa2.sunbasedata.com/sunbase/portal/api/assignment.jsp?cmd=get_customer_list

# Delete a customer
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer token_recieved_in_authentication_API_call" -d "cmd=delete&uuid=uuid_of_a_specific_customer" https://qa2.sunbasedata.com/sunbase/portal/api/assignment.jsp

# Update a customer
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer token_recieved_in_authentication_API_call" -d '{"first_name": "Jane", "last_name": "Doe", "street": "Elvnu Street", "address": "H no 2", "city": "Delhi", "state": "Delhi", "email": "sam@gmail.com", "phone": "12345678"}' https://qa2.sunbasedata.com/sunbase/portal/api/assignment.jsp?cmd=update&uuid=uuid_of_a_specific_customer
```
